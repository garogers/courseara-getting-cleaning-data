# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning Data", available in Coursera.

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps of the final assignment.

The output of the 5th step is called `TidySet.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's upload form.
